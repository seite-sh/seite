title: seite
description: seite is an AI-native static site generator for startup teams tired of managing too many tools for something that should be simple. Every page ships as HTML for browsers, Markdown for LLMs, and structured data for search engines. Use the Claude Code or Codex subscription you already have. Single binary. Zero dependencies.
extra:
  feature_4_body: Canonical URLs, Open Graph, JSON-LD structured data, XML sitemap, and per-page robots directives — generated automatically. Plus <code>llms.txt</code> and <code>llms-full.txt</code> for LLM discovery. Traditional SEO and generative engine optimization handled in one build.
  comparison_headline: One tool. Everything your site needs.
