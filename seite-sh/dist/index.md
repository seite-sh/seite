title: seite
description: seite is an AI-native static site generator for startup teams tired of managing too many tools for something that should be simple. Every page ships as HTML for browsers, Markdown for LLMs, and structured data for search engines. Use the Claude Code or Codex subscription you already have. Single binary. Zero dependencies.
extra:
  dogfood_line: This site is built with seite — the docs, the changelog, the llms.txt. All of it.
  feature_1_title: Sub-second builds. Always.
  compare_1_how: content/index.md + template
  cta_headline: Your coding agent can handle your website.
  feature_5_title: One command. Three targets. Auto-generated CI.
  ribbon_3: <span class="ribbon-highlight">6</span> bundled themes
  compare_1_need: Landing page
  step_1_title: Install seite
  hero_line_2: Not a sprint.
  feature_6_body: 'Default, dark, minimal, docs, brutalist, and bento. Or: <code>seite theme create "coral brutalist with lime accents"</code>. The agent generates the CSS. You review it. Ship it.'
  step_4_title: Deploy anywhere
  feature_2_body: Every <code>seite init</code> generates a <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> context file so Claude Code (and other agents) can orient themselves immediately. Run <code>seite agent "..."</code> and it reads your schema, your templates, your content — before it touches anything.
