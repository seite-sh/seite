Build discoverability and a contributor on-ramp for community themes.

- **Curated theme registry** — `themes.json` listing community themes with name, description, author, install URL, and preview
- **`seite theme browse`** — fetch and display available community themes with filtering
- **`seite theme validate`** — check a `.tera` file for required blocks, SEO meta, accessibility, and search JS before publishing
- **GitHub discovery** — `page-theme` topic, template repo, naming conventions
- **Community showcase** — gallery on seite.sh with live previews and one-click install
- **Contributor guide** — docs page explaining how to create, test, validate, and submit themes
