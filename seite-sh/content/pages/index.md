description: "seite is an AI-native static site generator for startup teams tired of managing too many tools for something that should be simple. Every page ships as HTML for browsers, Markdown for LLMs, and structured data for search engines. Use the Claude Code or Codex subscription you already have. Single binary. Zero dependencies."

  origin_line: "Started as an experiment. Built with Claude Code. Used on our own startup's site."

  features_eyebrow: "// features"
  features_headline_1: "Everything you need."
  features_headline_2: "Nothing you don't."
  features_sub: "HTML, markdown, RSS, sitemaps, search indexes, and LLM discovery files — from a single Rust binary with no runtime dependencies."

  feature_1_title: "Sub-second builds. Always."
  feature_1_body: "Single static binary for macOS, Linux, and Windows. No Node.js, no node_modules, no version managers. Install once, runs identically on every machine on your team."

  feature_2_title: "Your agent already knows how to use this."
  feature_2_body: "Every <code>seite init</code> generates a <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> context file so Claude Code (and other agents) can orient themselves immediately. Run <code>seite agent \"...\"</code> and it reads your schema, your templates, your content — before it touches anything."

  feature_3_title: "Ship in every language your customers speak."
  feature_3_body: "Filename-based translations with per-language URLs, RSS feeds, sitemaps, search indexes, and hreflang tags. Zero config for single-language sites — it's just there when you need it."

  feature_4_title: "Found by people. Found by models."
  feature_4_body: "Canonical URLs, Open Graph, JSON-LD structured data, XML sitemap, and per-page robots directives — generated automatically. Plus <code>llms.txt</code> and <code>llms-full.txt</code> for LLM discovery. Traditional SEO and generative engine optimization handled in one build."

  feature_5_title: "One command. Three targets. Auto-generated CI."
  feature_5_body: "GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, and Netlify — all built in. Pre-flight checks, <code>--dry-run</code> preview, and auto-generated GitHub Actions workflows so your site builds on every push."

  feature_6_title: "Six themes. Generate your own with a sentence."
  feature_6_body: "Default, dark, minimal, docs, brutalist, and bento. Or: <code>seite theme create \"coral brutalist with lime accents\"</code>. The agent generates the CSS. You review it. Ship it."

  comparison_headline: "Stop juggling six tools for one website."
  comparison_sub: "Most teams stitch together a CMS, a form provider, a deploy pipeline, and a changelog tool — then glue it with scripts. seite handles all of it."

  quickstart_eyebrow: "// quickstart"
  quickstart_title_1: "Up and running in thirty seconds."

  step_1_title: "Install seite"
  step_1_body: "<code>curl -fsSL seite.sh/install.sh | sh</code> on macOS/Linux, <code>irm seite.sh/install.ps1 | iex</code> on Windows. Single static binary, no runtime dependencies. Works on every machine on your team without setup."
  step_2_title: "Scaffold your site"
  step_2_body: "<code>seite init mysite</code>. Generates config, templates, collection presets, and <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> — so your coding agent is immediately oriented."
  step_3_title: "Create content with your agent"
  step_3_body: "<code>seite agent \"write about X\"</code>. Claude Code reads your site context and generates content into the right directory, with the right frontmatter, in the right format. Review a diff. Ship it."
  step_4_title: "Deploy anywhere"
  step_4_body: "<code>seite deploy</code>. Pre-flight checks, build, push. GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, or Netlify — all built in. Or run <code>seite deploy --setup-ci</code> for an auto-generated GitHub Actions workflow."

  dogfood_line: "This site is built with seite — the docs, the changelog, the llms.txt. All of it."

  cta_headline: "Your coding agent can handle your website."
  cta_sub: "Give it the right structure and it will. One repo. One CLI. Your whole web presence."
