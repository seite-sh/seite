## Image Processing

- JPEG encoding now respects the `quality` setting in `[images]` config (previously used default quality)
- WebP encoding switched from lossless-only (`image` crate) to lossy via `libwebp` (`webp` crate), producing significantly smaller files at the configured quality level
- PNG encoding unchanged (lossless by nature, quality setting does not apply)
