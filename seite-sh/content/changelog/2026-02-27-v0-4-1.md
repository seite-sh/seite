## AI Integration

- MCP `seite://content` now includes `subdomain`, `subdomain_url`, and `deploy_project` fields per collection
- MCP `seite_build` response includes `subdomain_builds` array with collection name, subdomain, base URL, and output directory

## Developer Experience

- `seite init` scaffolded CLAUDE.md now documents subdomain collections (base URL, preview path, deploy project) and includes `dist-subdomains/` in project structure
- `seite upgrade` adds Subdomain Deploys section to CLAUDE.md and `dist-subdomains/` to .gitignore for existing projects upgrading to 0.4.x
- Config reference scaffold documents `subdomain` and `deploy_project` collection fields
- Features scaffold lists subdomain deploys
