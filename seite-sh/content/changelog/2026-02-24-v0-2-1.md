## Build Pipeline

- Added `public/` directory support — files in `public/` are copied to the output root (`dist/`) before generation, enabling `favicon.ico`, `.well-known/`, `_redirects`, and other root-level files without the `/static/` prefix
- Conflict warnings when a `public/` file would be overwritten by a generated file (e.g., `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`)
- New `public_dir` config option in `[build]` section (defaults to `"public"`)
- Dev server and workspace server now watch the `public/` directory for changes

## Themes

- Added `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">` to all 6 bundled themes
- Added `title="Markdown"` attribute to the markdown alternate link in all themes
- Fixed `og:image` and `twitter:image` URLs — relative image paths are now absolutized with `base_url` during build so social previews work correctly

## Developer Experience

- `seite init` now creates a `public/` directory alongside `static/` and `data/`
- `seite upgrade` creates `public/` for existing projects upgrading to v0.2.1
- Link checker skips `/favicon.ico` since it's theme-injected and the file is optional
