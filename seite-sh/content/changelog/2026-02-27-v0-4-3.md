## Collection Index Pages

- Added support for `content/{collection}/index.md` — any collection can now have a custom index page that injects content into the collection's index template as `{{ page.content }}`
- Works identically to how `content/pages/index.md` provides homepage content, but for any collection
- The `index.md` is extracted from the collection listing so it doesn't appear as a regular item
- For paginated collections, the `index.md` content appears on page 1

## Docs Index Template

- New default `docs-index.html` template — docs collections now get a dedicated index page with sidebar navigation, matching individual doc pages
- When `content/docs/index.md` exists, it renders as the landing page with full sidebar
- When no `index.md` exists, auto-generates a section overview grouped by subdirectory
- Sidebar nav (`{{ nav }}`) is now passed to all collection index templates (both paginated and non-paginated), not just individual pages

## Redirect Support

- Collection index pages now support `extra.redirect_to` in frontmatter — set a URL to redirect `/docs/` to a specific doc page (e.g., `/docs/getting-started`)
- Works for both regular collection indexes and subdomain roots
- Generates an instant HTML redirect (meta refresh + JavaScript)

## Subdomain Root Pages

- Subdomain collections now support root pages via `content/{collection}/index.md` — e.g., `content/docs/index.md` renders at `docs.example.com/`
- Subdomain roots also support `redirect_to` for routing to a specific page
