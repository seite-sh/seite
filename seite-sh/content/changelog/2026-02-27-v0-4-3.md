## Collection Index Pages

- Added support for `content/{collection}/index.md` — any collection can now have a custom index page that injects content into the collection's index template as `{{ page.content }}`
- Works identically to how `content/pages/index.md` provides homepage content, but for any collection
- The `index.md` is extracted from the collection listing so it doesn't appear as a regular item

## Subdomain Root Pages

- Subdomain collections now support root pages via `content/{collection}/index.md` — e.g., `content/docs/index.md` renders at `docs.example.com/`
- Previously, subdomain roots could only show an auto-generated collection listing with no custom content

## Paginated Collections

- For paginated collections, the `index.md` content appears on page 1 of the collection index
