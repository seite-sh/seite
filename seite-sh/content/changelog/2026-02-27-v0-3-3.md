Further build pipeline optimizations: eliminate redundant file walks and per-page allocations.

- **Link checking folded into post-process pass** — internal link validation now runs during the existing HTML post-processing walk instead of a separate file read pass
- **Cached i18n context per language** — the 37-key UI strings JSON object is now built once per language instead of reconstructed on every page render
- **Hoisted shortcode site context** — the identical `sc_site` JSON is pre-computed once instead of rebuilt per page during content processing
- **Removed redundant string clone** — `expanded_body.clone()` eliminated when math rendering is disabled

1k pages cold build: ~357ms → ~275ms on Apple M4 Pro (cumulative from v0.3.1: ~443ms → ~275ms, 38% faster).
