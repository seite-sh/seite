## Bug Fix: Upgrade Version Stamping

- Fixed `seite upgrade` not updating the version in `.seite/config.json` when no file-level actions were needed
- Previously, if all upgrade step checks found nothing to create/merge/append (e.g., upgrading from 0.4.0 to 0.4.3 with no new upgrade steps), the version would remain at the old value even though the upgrade reported success
- Now the version is always stamped to the current binary version, even when there are no file changes to apply
- Fixed "page" references in upgrade success messages to say "seite"
