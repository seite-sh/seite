## Build Pipeline

- Per-collection subdomain support: set `subdomain = "docs"` on a collection to build it into `dist-subdomains/docs/` with its own sitemap, RSS, robots.txt, llms.txt, and search index
- Cross-subdomain link rewriting: internal links targeting subdomain collections are automatically rewritten to absolute URLs (e.g., `/docs/setup` becomes `https://docs.example.com/setup`)
- Reverse link rewriting for subdomain sites: links from subdomain content back to main-site collections resolve to absolute main-site URLs

## Deploy

- Subdomain collections deploy independently to their own Cloudflare Pages or Netlify projects via per-collection `deploy_project` config
- `seite deploy --setup` auto-creates Cloudflare/Netlify projects for subdomain collections (`{main-project}-{subdomain}` naming) and writes `deploy_project` back to seite.toml
- Dry-run output now shows subdomain deploy plan alongside main site
- GitHub Pages warning when subdomain collections are configured (subdomains not supported on GH Pages)
- Workspace deploy detects cross-site domain conflicts (e.g., subdomain overlapping another site's base_url)

## Developer Experience

- Dev server previews subdomain content at `/{name}-preview/` paths
- `.gitignore` now includes `dist-subdomains/` for new projects
- Config validation rejects duplicate subdomain values across collections
