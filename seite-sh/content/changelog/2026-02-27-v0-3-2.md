Parallelize the build pipeline with rayon and consolidate HTML post-processing for faster builds.

- **Rayon parallelism** across content processing (5x faster), image processing (3x faster), page rendering, markdown output, and HTML post-processing
- **Single-pass HTML post-processing** — image srcset rewriting, code copy button injection, base path URL rewriting, and analytics injection now run in one read-transform-write pass instead of four separate file walks
- **New `bench/profile.sh`** for flamegraph profiling with samply
- **Enhanced `bench/run.sh`** with per-step timing capture and `--with-images` flag

1k pages cold build: ~443ms → ~357ms on Apple M4 Pro.
