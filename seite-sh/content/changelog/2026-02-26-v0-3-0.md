## 4 New Bundled Themes

- **Landing** — Light SaaS landing page theme with Fraunces/Outfit fonts. Hero section, feature cards with accent borders, 4-column stats grid, testimonial blocks, asymmetric post grid
- **Terminal** — Dark terminal aesthetic with IBM Plex Mono, green accent (`#00ff41`), scanline effects, blinking cursor, monospace throughout
- **Magazine** — Editorial newspaper theme with Playfair Display/Source Serif 4/DM Sans. 3-column article grid, full-width lead article, editorial masthead with diamond dividers
- **Academic** — Tufte-inspired scholarly theme with EB Garamond serif. Narrow reading column (60%), small-caps section headings, sidenote-style footnotes, section symbols

## 2026 Design Refresh for All Themes

Every bundled theme upgraded with:

- **Google Fonts** — Each theme gets a distinctive typeface: Outfit (default), Lora (minimal), Sora (dark), IBM Plex Sans/Mono (docs), Archivo + DM Mono (brutalist), Manrope (bento)
- **Homepage content styles** — Rich `.homepage-content` CSS for landing pages with styled headings, stat grids, blockquotes, and feature lists
- **Safe DOM search** — Search JavaScript rewritten to use `createElement`/`textContent`/`appendChild` instead of `innerHTML`

## SEO/GEO Improvements

- Skip `loading="lazy"` on first image per page to preserve LCP performance
- Improved AI crawler management in `robots.txt` — allow search crawlers, block training crawlers
