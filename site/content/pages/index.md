title: "page"
description: "page is an AI-native static site generator for startup teams tired of managing too many tools for something that should be simple. Every page ships as HTML for browsers, Markdown for LLMs, and structured data for search engines. Use the Claude Code or Codex subscription you already have. Single binary. Zero dependencies."

  features_sub: "A 13-step build pipeline that outputs HTML, markdown, RSS, sitemaps, search indexes, and LLM discovery files. All from a single Rust binary with no runtime dependencies."

  feature_1_title: "Sub-second builds. Always."
  feature_1_body: "13-step build pipeline compiled to a single static binary. No Node.js, no node_modules, no version managers. Install once, runs identically on every machine on your team."

  feature_2_title: "Your agent already knows how to use this."
  feature_2_body: "Every <code>page init</code> generates a <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> context file so Claude Code (and other agents) can orient themselves immediately. Run <code>page agent \"...\"</code> and it reads your schema, your templates, your content — before it touches anything."

  feature_3_title: "Ship in every language your customers speak."
  feature_3_body: "Filename-based translations with per-language URLs, RSS feeds, sitemaps, search indexes, and hreflang tags. Zero config for single-language sites — it's just there when you need it."

  feature_4_title: "Found by people. Found by models."
  feature_4_body: "Canonical URLs, Open Graph, JSON-LD structured data, XML sitemap, and per-page robots directives — generated automatically. Plus <code>llms.txt</code> and <code>llms-full.txt</code> for LLM discovery. Traditional SEO and generative engine optimization handled in one build."

  feature_5_title: "One command. Three targets. Auto-generated CI."
  feature_5_body: "GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, and Netlify — all built in. Pre-flight checks, <code>--dry-run</code> preview, and auto-generated GitHub Actions workflows so your site builds on every push."

  feature_6_title: "Six themes. Generate your own with a sentence."
  feature_6_body: "Default, dark, minimal, docs, brutalist, and bento. Or: <code>page theme create \"coral brutalist with lime accents\"</code>. The agent generates the CSS. You review it. Ship it."

  step_2_title: "Scaffold your site"
  step_2_body: "<code>page init mysite</code>. Generates config, templates, collection presets, and <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> — so your coding agent is immediately oriented."
  step_3_title: "Create content with your agent"
  step_3_body: "<code>page agent \"write about X\"</code>. Claude Code reads your site context and generates content into the right directory, with the right frontmatter, in the right format. Review a diff. Ship it."
  step_4_title: "Deploy anywhere"
  step_4_body: "<code>page deploy</code>. Pre-flight checks, build, push. GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, or Netlify — all built in. Or run <code>page deploy --setup-ci</code> for an auto-generated GitHub Actions workflow."
