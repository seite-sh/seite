title: page
description: page is an AI-native static site generator for startup teams tired of managing too many tools for something that should be simple. Every page ships as HTML for browsers, Markdown for LLMs, and structured data for search engines. Use the Claude Code or Codex subscription you already have. Single binary. Zero dependencies.
extra:
  ribbon_4: <span class="ribbon-highlight">zero</span> runtime deps
  hero_accent: in an afternoon.
  feature_1_title: Sub-second builds. Always.
  step_1_title: Install page
  ribbon_1: <span class="ribbon-highlight">curl -fsSL</span> pagecli.dev/install.sh | sh
  origin_line: Started as an experiment. Built with Claude Code. Used on our own startup's site.
  feature_3_title: Ship in every language your customers speak.
  compare_col_1: What you need
  compare_1_need: Landing page
  compare_2_how: docs collection preset
  quickstart_eyebrow: // quickstart

  features_headline_2: Nothing you don't.
  features_eyebrow: // features
  hero_line_1: Ship a landing page, docs site, or blog
  feature_2_body: Every <code>page init</code> generates a <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> context file so Claude Code (and other agents) can orient themselves immediately. Run <code>page agent "..."</code> and it reads your schema, your templates, your content — before it touches anything.
  feature_5_title: One command. Three targets. Auto-generated CI.
  compare_5_need: Roadmap
  feature_6_body: 'Default, dark, minimal, docs, brutalist, and bento. Or: <code>page theme create "coral brutalist with lime accents"</code>. The agent generates the CSS. You review it. Ship it.'
  step_2_title: Scaffold your site
  feature_2_title: Your agent already knows how to use this.
  feature_3_body: Filename-based translations with per-language URLs, RSS feeds, sitemaps, search indexes, and hreflang tags. Zero config for single-language sites — it's just there when you need it.
  step_2_body: <code>page init mysite</code>. Generates config, templates, collection presets, and <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> — so your coding agent is immediately oriented.
  dogfood_line: This site is built with page — the docs, the changelog, the llms.txt. All of it.
  compare_5_how: roadmap collection preset
  compare_4_how: changelog collection preset
  compare_4_need: Changelog
  comparison_sub: No new subscriptions. Just the coding agent you already have.
  step_4_body: <code>page deploy</code>. Pre-flight checks, build, push. GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, or Netlify — all built in. Or run <code>page deploy --setup-ci</code> for an auto-generated GitHub Actions workflow.
  cta_sub: Give it the right structure and it will. One repo. One CLI. Your whole web presence.
  ribbon_3: <span class="ribbon-highlight">6</span> bundled themes
  hero_sub: One repo. One CLI. Your whole web presence — built with the coding agent you already use.
  compare_col_2: How
  hero_badge: Built in Rust · AI-native · Open source
  step_3_body: <code>page agent "write about X"</code>. Claude Code reads your site context and generates content into the right directory, with the right frontmatter, in the right format. Review a diff. Ship it.
  hero_line_2: Not a sprint.
  compare_2_need: Documentation
  step_3_title: Create content with your agent
  features_sub: A 13-step build pipeline that outputs HTML, markdown, RSS, sitemaps, search indexes, and LLM discovery files. All from a single Rust binary with no runtime dependencies.
