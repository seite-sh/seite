## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in seite, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/seite-sh/seite/security/advisories/new) to report the vulnerability privately. This allows us to assess and fix the issue before public disclosure.

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could achieve)
- Suggested fix, if any

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: within 1 week
- **Fix and disclosure**: coordinated with reporter, typically within 30 days

## Supply Chain Security

seite binaries distributed via GitHub Releases include:

- **SHA-256 checksums** (`checksums-sha256.txt`) for every release artifact
- **SLSA Level 3 provenance** attestations generated by the [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator)

The install script (`curl -fsSL https://seite.sh/install.sh | sh`) verifies checksums before installing.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The `seite` binary and its Rust source code
- The install scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`)
- The self-update mechanism (`seite self-update`)
- The MCP server (`seite mcp`)
- The documentation site (seite.sh)

Out of scope:

- Sites generated by seite (those are user-owned)
- Third-party themes installed via `seite theme install`
