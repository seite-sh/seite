### Landing Page Builder Skill

Run `/landing-page` to start a guided flow for creating or redesigning any landing page — the site homepage, a product page, a launch page, or any standalone marketing page. The skill walks through messaging and positioning first (audience, value prop, voice, differentiation), drafts the actual copy for approval, then proposes page structure and builds the content file and Tera template. Iterates until you are happy with the result.
