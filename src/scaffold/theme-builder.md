### Theme Builder Skill

Run `/theme-builder` to create or customize your site's theme interactively. The skill walks through site purpose, audience, and visual direction first (mood, references, screenshots, colors, typography, layout), then generates a complete `templates/base.html` with all SEO, accessibility, search, pagination, and i18n requirements built in. Iterates until you are happy with the result.
